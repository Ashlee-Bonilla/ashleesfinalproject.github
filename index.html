     <h1>Writing Reflection 2</h1>
<body> everytime im asked about what my work is i always say visual communications is what i do, illustration, graphic design, and typography. but thats just a day job to me,
i love to sculp digitally and traditionally, and if we lived in a perfect world i would be making mosters for a living. But a girls gotta eat and pay rent so Viscom it is.
i get pretty vivid nightmares/dreams and sometimes ill have a good idea that sprouts from them that i want to bring to life. ive always gotten
really excited to start working on passion projects that o matter how tired i am i cant sleep. and when i finish a work i let it rest for a few days, until i inevitably pick it apart so much so that it births new iterations.</body>
